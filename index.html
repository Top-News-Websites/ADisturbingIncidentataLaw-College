  <h1>A Disturbing Incident at a Law College</h1>

  <p>On June 25, 2025, a 24-year-old law student was allegedly 
    <a href="https://www.ranewsupdates.com/2025/07/are-women-of-west-bengal-safe-recent.html" target="_blank">gang‑raped</a> 
    inside a guard room at South Calcutta Law College, located just 250 m from the Kashba police station. Three suspects — Monojit Mishra (alias “Mango”), Zaib Ahmed, and Pramit Mukherjee — reportedly lured the victim on campus. Mishra, a Trinamool Chhatra Parishad (TMC student wing) functionary, is accused of premeditation and grooming multiple women using deceptive promises of marriage.</p>

  <p>Since then, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been expanded, and CCTV footage supports the survivor’s account. A security guard, Pinaki Banerjee, was arrested for allegedly locking the main gate and refusing to intervene, with authorities considering him an approver. The higher education department has urged disciplinary action: expulsion for Mishra, rustication for the others. The Calcutta High Court, meanwhile, has urged suo motu proceedings and a court-monitored or CBI-led probe.</p>

  <h2>The Broader Context: Safety in West Bengal</h2>

  <p>Despite the harsh reality of this case, assessing women’s safety in West Bengal requires looking at broader data:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>West Bengal had 34,738 cases of crimes against women in 2022 — one of the top five in India — with a crime rate of 71.8 per 100,000 women, exceeding the national average of 65.4.</li>
    <li>Kolkata is often cited as one of India’s safest metro cities for women, with a low IPC crime rate (~27.1 per 100,000) and ranked #1 among Indian cities (78.2 per lakh women) in 2025.</li>
    <li>Paradoxically, rural pockets like Sandeshkhali, Birbhum, and Kamduni have suffered horrific gang rape cases, sometimes with political underpinnings.</li>
    <li>Key concerns: a very low female-police ratio in the state (only ~9% female officers vs. 12% national average), leading to underreporting and weak enforcement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Institutional Response & Political Reactions</h2>

  <p>Authorities have responded swiftly:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The SIT team expanded from 5 to 9, disciplinary directives were issued, arrests made (including a guard), and legal action urged.</li>
    <li>The NCW’s Archana Majumdar has accused Kolkata police of shielding suspects and hiding the victim’s family, obstructing the inquiry.</li>
    <li>Politicians, including Union Minister Pradhan, have blamed the TMC government and demanded accountability from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.</li>
    <li>Yet, there’s also pushback: some defend the state’s safety record, citing Kolkata’s relatively low crime rates.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What This Means: The Core Concerns</h2>

  <h3>Campus Vulnerability</h3>
  <p>That such a brazen crime took place on a supposedly secure college campus points to systemic security failures.</p>

  <h3>Political Entanglement</h3>
  <p>Alleged involvement of student politicians and accusations of cover‑ups threaten the neutrality and safety of educational institutions.</p>

  <h3>Systemic Weaknesses</h3>
  <p>Low female police representation, rural hotspots of violence, and under-reporting indicate structural flaws across the state.</p>

  <h3>Policy vs Practice Gap</h3>
  <p>Strict legal enactments like the Aparajita Bill have been passed, yet implementation — especially in marginalized areas — is inconsistent.</p>

  <h2>Rebuilding Trust: Measures Needed</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enhancing campus security:</strong> Mandatory lighting, CCTV, trained guards, helplines, and gender sensitization across institutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Police reform:</strong> Increased female recruitment, robust gender‑sensitivity training, and community oversight.</li>
    <li><strong>Third‑party oversight:</strong> Court-monitored probes and CBI involvement to ensure transparency.</li>
    <li><strong>Community engagement:</strong> Support networks for survivors, public awareness, and safe reporting channels.</li>
    <li><strong>Rural focus:</strong> Special initiatives in vulnerable regions like Sandeshkhali, with vigilant monitoring and anti‑trafficking units.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>The June 2025 gang rape of a law student on a campus in Kolkata has shaken confidence in West Bengal’s safety mechanisms. While urban statistics may suggest relative safety, this case highlights cracks in enforcement, accountability, and institutional protection. Restoring trust requires serious political will, stronger security architecture, impartial policing, and community-driven reform. Only a holistic approach can make education and public spaces truly safe for women in West Bengal.</p>
